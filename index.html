                        <h3>Hi, there!</h3>
                        <p>My name is Antoaneta, but everyone call me Tonia.</p>
                        <p>I was born on 19 August 1978, in Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>I have two sons and a loony cat.</p>
                        <p>Probably the most interesting thing about Bulgarians 
                        are our "yes" and "no" head gestures - we nod for "no" and shake our heads for "yes".
                        Or use a strange mixture only clear to us. I'll be careful to use the normal gestures but
                        if you're confused, just ask ;-) </p>
                        <p>I'm a very friendly and easygoing person, I love being around people 
                        and I actually need a team to be able to work efficiently.</p>

                        <h3>Occupation</h3>
                        <p>I left my job so I can be glued to my laptop studying JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>I have been a customs inspector, an airport security, a tech support, a stay-at-home mum.. 
                        and several other things before that.</p>

                                <h3>Entertainment</h3>
                                <p>Let's see.. </p>
                                <p>If I'm with my children - a long walk in the forest, or along the beach. Or watching movies with large quantities of popcorn.</p>
                                <p>If I'm with friends - beer, good food and good music, and it doesn't matter where we are. As long as it is warm enough ;-)</p>
                                <p>If I'm alone - going out for some picture taking; reading a good book; fooling around with CSS. 
                                    My ideal self is a person that has fun fooling around with JavaScript. I'm working towards it.</p>

                <section class="content hidden" id="interests">
                        <h3>Interests</h3>
                        <p>I'm interested in web development. My greatest interest at the moment.</p>
                        <p><b>Otherwise:</b>
                                <p><u>Photography</u> - I like taking pictures, it makes one more aware of the their surroundings. Gives a unique, 
                                multi - perspective of the object.</p>
                                <p><u>Politics</u> - not that I'm a huge fan, I just like to be informed baout what's going on aour planet.</p>
                                <p><u>Languages</u> - I once used to be able to speak in Russian and French too. They are forgotten now. But I'm still 
                                very curious about the native language of every vountry I go and every person I meet and usually I'm able to 
                                learn and remember a few words of each language.
                                </p><u>Ecology</u> - I love nature, and I love animals (except for bugs - they make me scream). 
                                Recycling, alternative energy sources, sustainable agriculture and bulding are part of my interests.</p>
                                <p><u>Education</u> - I believe that current standard education is lagging behind .. life. So the society must come up with 
                                a new system. Put simply of course.</p>
                                <p><u>Crafts</u> - things done with hands - I personally love assemblying furniture. Making some small furniture pieces from scratch too.
                                Drawing, tying knots, weaving, knitting - all these are great relaxing techniques. And they are fun.
                                </p>
